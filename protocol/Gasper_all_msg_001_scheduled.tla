-------------------- MODULE Gasper_all_msg_001_scheduled ---------------------------
(*
 A TLA+ specification of a simplified Ethereum consensus, in which all honest validators
 are forced to vote

 - Since the blocks are implicit, if a validator voted for an invalid block, this is
   equivalent to the case when the validator skipped voting ... ?
 
 - The protocol runs for a fixed number of epochs, with a fixed set of validators

 - All validators have an equal weight

 - All Byzantine attestations are decided at the beginning of a protocol execution, 
   satisfing very few constraints.

 - Asynchronous channels are modelled by gradually releasing a subset of all 
   attestations which are time-stamped to be less than or equal to the 
   current slot, received honest validators. (at the moment all attestations 
   are supposed to be received by all validators)

 - We define a super set of all possible behaviour of honest validators. Dishonest 
   validators are unconstrained. All behaviours are encoded in the initial set of
   FFG attestations. *** We do not model HLMD Ghost at this stage ***

 - We focus on the safety property only: for any honest validators v1 and v2, the 
   most recent finalized block must be compatible (i.e., they are the same block, 
   or one block is an ancestor of the other)
